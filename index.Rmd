## Still undecided?

Look, we will make this simple. We will decide by the luck of the draw. We will draw a standard normal random variable: if it is negative: you will not get daRt. If it is positive, you will get daRt!!!

## The results...

```{r}
d <- rnorm(1)
print(d)

if(d < 0) {
    print("Nope. You are apparantely too good for my game... :(")
} else {
    print("Congrats! You will get daRt!")
}

```
